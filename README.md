# Introduction
The goal of the project is to create a flashcard app that would allow users to add text, images, video, and sound to the app to be able to make a flashcard. The flash card would have a question and an answer section that the user can fill up. After making the flashcard, the users would be able to review them. The users would also be able to group th flashcard together to organise them.
